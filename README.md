## 🎯 Introduction
Banks and financial institutions receive thousands of loan service request emails daily. These emails require manual classification, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and errors. Common challenges include:

- **Manual Processing Delays**: Loan officers spend hours sorting and responding to emails, delaying critical loan processing tasks.
- **High Error Rate in Categorization**: Misclassification can lead to delays in approvals and compliance risks.
- **Scalability Issues**: As the volume of loan requests grows, manual processing becomes increasingly unsustainable.

## Solution
This AI-powered system automates loan request classification by:

- ✅ **Automating Email Processing** → Extracting loan request types, key attributes, and relevant details from emails & attachments.
- ✅ **Enhancing Accuracy** → Utilizing LLM-based classification to improve precision in sorting loan-related emails.
- ✅ **Speeding Up Response Time** → Enabling near-instant classification and forwarding to the right department.
- ✅ **Seamless Integration** → Connecting with CRM & Loan Management Systems via API for structured data output.
